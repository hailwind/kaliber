## Purpose

This internal package consolidates the functions needed to access the `Calibre` database.
I wanted all this files together in one place to better design their interactions and perform tests as needed.

## Usage

This internal package is _not_ meant to be used from outside `Kaliber`.

## Libraries

The following external libraries were used building `kaliber/db`:

* [ApacheLogger](https://github.com/mwat56/apachelogger)
* [SQLite3](https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3)
