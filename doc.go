NOTE: While formally this is a library (`package`) in reality it's sort
of a toolbox for the `main` package (the file of which is in the `app`
sub-directory). In other words: this library is not supposed to be
imported into other projects.

The publicly documented functions and methods are an arbitrary selection.
In fact, most of the functionality of this `library` is implemented in
private functions. Most of the `public` functions/methods are only public
because they may be called from outside the source code file they were
written in.

	For a real understanding you're encouraged to read the source code and the comments therein.
